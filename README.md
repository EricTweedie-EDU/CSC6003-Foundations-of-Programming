Repo will contain all the projects from this course

# Contents

# Module 1
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a radius of a circle/sphere. Using the radius that is entered, the program must calculate and display the circumference and area of a circle and the volume of a sphere with that radius and then print the results to the screen.

# Module 2
Asks for two positive integers and returns True if either evenly divides the other. The function should keep asking for entries if the wrong ones are entered. The result (boolean) should be displayed in the calling function

# Module 3
Develop a Python program that analyzes a given sentence to provide some insights about it.
Ask the user to provide a sentence with at least 10 words.
Count and display the number of words in the sentence.
Count and display the number of vowels in the sentence.
Create a list of unique words in the sentence and display them.
Display the word(s) with the maximum length from the sentence.

# Module 4
Program to organize a music collection using a dictionary in Python.
Add a song: Prompt the user to enter the song title and artist, and add it to the music collection.
Retrieve song details: Prompt the user to enter a song title, and display the corresponding artist from the music collection.
Update song details: Prompt the user to enter a song title, and update the artist information in the music collection.
Delete a song: Prompt the user to enter a song title, and remove the corresponding song from the music collection.
Display all songs: Display all songs in the music collection.

# Module 5
Assume you are working in a hospital and are maintaining personnel records on doctors, surgeons, and nurses.
To do this, you need to create the Personnel class. Create three types of personnel -- a child class Doctor,  a child class Surgeon, and a child class Nurse. Create attributes name, age, and hourlyRate

# Module 6
Write a Python function called calculate_area_of_rectangle that takes two parameters, length and width, representing the length and width of a rectangle, respectively. The function should return the area of the rectangle.
Write a proper docstring for the function, explaining its purpose, parameters, returns, and input/output parameters.
Additionally, write doctests to test the function using different inputs and expected outputs. You should test at least five different inputs including at least one input that causes the code to fail the test. 
Finally, create an additional test for this code using python Unit Tests

# Module 7
Take two sorting algorithms and prove (with timestamps evidence) which one is better.
Write your own program to generate a large number of random numbers and sort them using any two algorithms. Add time stamps (you can use the sample program I have provided in the module contents) and prove that one algorithm is more efficient than the other one.

# Module 8 Final Project
You have been assigned the task of creating a bank account management system. The system should allow users to create bank accounts, deposit funds, withdraw funds, check the account balance, and perform transfers between accounts. Implement the program using object-oriented programming, lists, dictionaries, and recursion.
